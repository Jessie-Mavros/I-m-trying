BY EMILY DICKINSON
<br>
My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -
<br>
In Corners - till a Day
<br>
The Owner passed - identified -
<br>
And carried Me away -

<br>
And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
<br>
And now We hunt the Doe -
<br>
And every time I speak for Him
<br>
The Mountains straight reply -
<br>
And do I smile, such cordial light
<br>
Opon the Valley glow -
<br>
It is as a Vesuvian face
<br>
Had let it’s pleasure through -
<br>
And when at Night - Our good Day done -
<br>
I guard My Master’s Head -
<br>
’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
<br>
Deep Pillow - to have shared -
<br>
To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
<br>
None stir the second time -
<br>
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
<br>
Or an emphatic Thumb -
<br>
Though I than He - may longer live
<br>
He longer must - than I -
<br>
For I have but the power to kill,
<br>
Without - the power to die -
